# ðŸ“š Open-Source Training Data for TextPixs

This directory acknowledges the crucial role of publicly available datasets in the development and enhancement of the TextPixs model. These open-source resources, comprising vast collections of text-image pairs, have been instrumental in training and improving our text-to-image generation architecture, particularly in achieving higher text fidelity and visual quality.

Below is a list of key datasets that significantly contributed to our research and model development:

## Featured Datasets:

- **LAION-5B**: One of the largest open-source image-text datasets, containing over five billion image-text pairs. Its scale has been invaluable for pre-training and general image-text understanding.
